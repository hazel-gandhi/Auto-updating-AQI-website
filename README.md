## Auto-updating AQI website
#### This website shows the daily AQI of 250 Indian cities by pulling data from India's Pollution Control Board
Link to the project: https://hazel-gandhi.github.io/Auto-updating-AQI-website/

The data diary is available in the "diary.md" file of this repo. It has  a detailed breakdown of my process and the challenges I faced while doing this project.

The main file that updates every day is "new_file_name.csv". 

"IndiaAQI3.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook with my code for scraping the pdfs put out by the Pollution Control Board's website.
