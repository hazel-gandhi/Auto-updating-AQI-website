Find a link to my project here: https://hazel-gandhi.github.io/Auto-updating-AQI-website/


This auto-updating website shows the daily AQI of 250 Indian cities.


My data diary is available inside the "diary.md" file of this repo. It has  a detailed breakdown of my process and the challenges I faced while doing this project.

The main file that updates every day is "new_file_name.csv". 

"IndiaAQI3.ipynb" is the main jupyter notebook with my code for scraping the pdfs.
